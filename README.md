Angular app for rental-checking in the Paris urban zone:

1. Tell me your flat data (like how many rooms you have, or how old is your building)
2. Give me your adress so I can determine in which zone you belong
3. Let me tell you how much you ought to pay per month. A fancy map of your surroundings is included.

Use google maps for reverse geolocalization and mapping, with geographic and rental data loaded asynchronously from json files.

Ready to deploy on heroku. Won't work on heroku without a dedicated commercial GM key, thought.
